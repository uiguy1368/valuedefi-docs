Provide Liquidity on Value Liquid - Written by yfvfinance.rocks

---

**Value Liquid allows users to provide liquidity to the Value Liquid Exchange. Liquidity providers get a share of the fees when someone makes a trade against the token you have provided liquidity for.**

When you provide Liquidity on Value Liquid you will receive VLP tokens. Additionally, you can then use your VLP tokens to farm for Value Rewards.

**Lets provide some liquidity and get Value Liquidity Pool (VLP) Tokens**

1. Go to https://valuedefi.io/ and select the pool you want to farm in:

For this tutorial i’m going to provide Liquidity for DAI/Value, for this I will receive VLP tokens. I can also use these tokens to farm Value.

2. You’ll see an icon to create a VLT for your selected pool. Click this to go to Liquid to create the token.

3. Value liquid will open with the appropriate pairs. The VALUE/DAI pair requires 80% DAI and 20% Value. Add the amount of DAI you want to use and then click ‘Setup Proxy’.

**Note:** _Steps 3-7 are only required if your wallet has never provided liquidity before. If you have already set up the proxy skip to step 8. The proxy will allow farmers to use the new Liquid technology for flexible farming when the full roadmap is released._
